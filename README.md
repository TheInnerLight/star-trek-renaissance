# Star Trek: Renaissance

This is the beginning of a mostly un-implemented mod for Star Trek: Infinity designed to better capture the TNG/DS9 feel of the ships, equipment and technology.

It will modify ships, weapons, technologies, etc according to the plan described below:

- [Ships](docs/ships.md)
- [Weapons](docs/weapons.md)
- Techs

Here's an overview of some ideas:

- Make most Federation military vessels capable of conducting science missions (only within logistics range)
- Lore friendly ship progression (e.g. excelsiors at the start and developing: galaxy -> intrepid -> sovereign to match the cannonical timeline)
- Lore friendly weapons progression (e.g. Type XII phaser arrays and type 6 photon torpedoes)
- Asymmetric starting ships
    - e.g.
      - Romulans starting with D'deridex warbirds
      - Cardassians with Galors
      - Federation with Miranda + Excelsior
      - Klingons with K'tinga
- Replace the D7-like warbird with the cruiser Bird of Prey-variant, K'Vort class (primarily from *Yesterday's Enterprise*).
  - K'tinga becomes smaller and the starting ship.
- Fix the timeline progression
  - Problems
    - Federation is missing lots of member worlds present during TNG/DS9
    - Ships become available far too late, e.g. Sovereign is unresearchable until 2456 when it appears in cannon by 2372.
  - TNG start in 2346?
    - Game needs to progress in years much more slowly so that the 2380s become "late game"
  - Late TOS start?
    - Fits better with the state of the empires as presented in the game
    - Need to avoid e.g. Khitomer event happening at the start and rework event timeline

More speculative ideas:

- Antimatter resource for Federation/Klingon/Cardassian
  - Antimatter factories to make it
  - Replace Deuterium?
- Transwarp
  - Techs to pass through transwarp conduits increasingly safely?
  - Quantum Slipstream drives?
