# Star Trek: Renaissance

This is the beginning of a mostly un-implemented mod for Star Trek: Infinity designed to better capture the TNG/DS9 feel of the ships, equipment and technology.

It will modify ships, weapons, technologies, etc according to the plan described below:

- [Ships](docs/ships.md)
- [Weapons](docs/weapons.md)
- Techs

Here's an overview of some ideas:

- Make most Federation military vessels capable of conducting science missions
- Lore friendly ship progression (e.g. excelsiors at the start and developing: galaxy -> intrepid -> sovereign to match the cannonical timeline)
- Lore friendly weapons progression (e.g. Type XII phaser arrays and type 6 photon torpedoes)

More speculative ideas:

- Antimatter resource for Federation/Klingon/Cardassian
  - Antimatter factories to make it
  - Replace Deuterium?
